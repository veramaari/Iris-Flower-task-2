# Iris-Flower-task-2
IRIS FLOWERðŸŒº CLASSIFICATION using Logistic Regression from a well-known dataset. where we used the Iris dataset to develop a model that classifies iris flowers into species based on their sepal and petal measurements. And compute the confusion matrix to compare true species labels with predicted cluster labels and visualize it with a heatmap.
